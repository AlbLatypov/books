# Intro

>__Ansible aims to be__:
>1. Clear - Ansible uses a simple syntax (YAML) and is easy for anyone (developers, sysadmins,
managers) to understand. APIs are simple and sensible.
>2. Fast - Fast to learn, fast to set up—especially considering you don’t need to install extra agents
or daemons on all your servers!
>3. Complete - Ansible does three things in one, and does them very well. Ansible’s ‘batteries
included’ approach means you have everything you need in one complete package.
>4. Efficient - No extra software on your servers means more resources for your applications.
>5. Secure - Ansible uses SSH, and requires no extra open ports or potentially-vulnerable daemons on your servers.

>We’ll explore all aspects of using Ansible to provision and manage your infrastructure in this book, but there’s no substitute for the wealth of documentation and community interaction that make Ansible great. Check out the links below to find out more about Ansible and discover the community:
- http://docs.ansible.com/ - Covers all Ansible options in depth. There are few open source projects with documentation as clear and thorough
- http://docs.ansible.com/glossary.html - If there’s ever a term in this book you don’t seem to fully understand, check the glossary.
